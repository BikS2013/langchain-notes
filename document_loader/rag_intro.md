# Introduction to RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

## What is RAG?

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with a knowledge base of documents to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses. Instead of relying solely on an LLM's pre-trained knowledge, RAG systems first retrieve relevant information from a document collection and then use this information to generate responses.

## How Does RAG Work?

1. **Document Processing**:
   - Documents are split into manageable chunks
   - Each chunk is converted into a vector embedding using models like OpenAI's embeddings
   - These embeddings are stored in a vector database for efficient retrieval

2. **Query Processing**:
   - When a question is asked, it's converted into the same embedding space
   - The system finds the most similar document chunks using semantic search
   - Relevant chunks are retrieved to provide context

3. **Response Generation**:
   - Retrieved context is combined with the original question
   - An LLM uses this information to generate a precise, factual response
   - The system can cite sources and provide evidence for its answers

## Key Benefits

- **Accuracy**: Responses are grounded in your specific documents
- **Up-to-date Information**: Knowledge base can be continuously updated
- **Source Attribution**: Answers can be traced back to source documents
- **Reduced Hallucination**: LLM responses are constrained by retrieved context
- **Customization**: System can be tailored to specific domains or use cases

## Common Applications

- Document question-answering
- Knowledge base search
- Customer support automation
- Research assistance
- Technical documentation search
- Legal document analysis
- Medical literature review

## Getting Started

RAG systems can be implemented using popular frameworks like LangChain, which provide the necessary components:
- Document loaders for various formats (PDF, HTML, etc.)
- Text splitters for chunking
- Vector stores (Chroma, FAISS, etc.)
- Embedding models
- LLM integrations

Start with a simple implementation and iterate based on your specific needs and performance requirements.
