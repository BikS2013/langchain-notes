## wsl installation on windows
I'll guide you through installing WSL on Windows. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Easiest Method** - Using Windows PowerShell (Run as Administrator):
```powershell
wsl --install
```
This command:
- Enables required Windows features
- Downloads and installs Ubuntu by default
- Requires a system restart

2. **After Restart**:
- WSL will automatically start
- You'll need to create a UNIX username and password
- This doesn't have to match your Windows credentials

3. **Alternative Method** - Manual steps if the simple command doesn't work:

First, enable WSL:
```powershell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
```

Then enable Virtual Machine Platform:
```powershell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
```

4. **System Requirements**:
- Windows 10 version 2004 or higher (Build 19041 or higher)
- Windows 11

5. **To install a different Linux distribution**:
```powershell
# List available distributions
wsl --list --online

# Install a specific distribution
wsl --install -d <DistributionName>
# Example: wsl --install -d Debian
```

After installation, you can access WSL by:
- Opening Windows Terminal and clicking the dropdown for WSL
- Typing `wsl` in Command Prompt or PowerShell
- Searching for "Ubuntu" (or your chosen distro) in the Start menu

Let me know if you encounter any issues during the installation!


## install pyenv to manage multiple python distributions 

I'll help you install pyenv in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Here's the step-by-step process:

0. Check internet connectivity & DNS resolution
a) ping 8.8.8.8 to check internet connectivity
b) ping google.com to check DNS resolution
if either step a) or step b) is not succesful, do the following
sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
sudo bash -c 'echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf'

1. Î™nstall the required dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev \
libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncursesw5-dev xz-utils \
tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev git
```

2. Clone the pyenv repository:
```bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

3. Add the following to your `~/.bashrc` (if using bash) or `~/.zshrc` (if using zsh):
a) First, let's find out which shell you're using
```bash
echo $SHELL
```
This will output something like /bin/bash or /bin/zsh
Based on your shell, you'll need to edit the correct configuration file:
For bash: ~/.bashrc
For zsh: ~/.zshrc
b) You can edit the file using any text editor like nano or vim. Let's use nano as it's simpler:
```bash
nano ~/.bashrc  # if using bash
# or
nano ~/.zshrc   # if using zsh
```
c) In the editor, scroll to the bottom and add these three lines:
```bash
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```
d) Save the file:
If using nano: Press Ctrl + X, then Y to confirm, then Enter to save
If using vim: Press Esc, type :wq, then press Enter

4. Reload your shell configuration:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc if using zsh
```

5. Verify the installation:
```bash
pyenv --version
```

Now you can install Python versions using:
```bash
pyenv install 3.12.0  # or any version you want
pyenv install 3.13.0  # or any version you want
pyenv global 3.12.0   # to set it as default
```

If you encounter any issues during installation, make sure all dependencies are properly installed and that your WSL instance has been updated.

## install VS Code in wsl 

I'll help you install VS Code for WSL. There are two main approaches:

1. **Recommended Method** - Install VS Code on Windows and use the WSL extension:

```bash
# First, install VS Code on Windows from the official website
# Then, in your WSL terminal:
code .
```
This will automatically:
- Install VS Code Server in WSL
- Install the WSL extension
- Open VS Code with WSL integration

2. **Alternative Method** - Install VS Code directly in WSL:
```bash
# Add Microsoft's GPG key
wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > packages.microsoft.gpg
sudo install -D -o root -g root -m 644 packages.microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64,arm64,armhf signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list'
rm -f packages.microsoft.gpg

# Install VS Code
sudo apt install apt-transport-https
sudo apt update
sudo apt install code
```

I recommend the first method because:
- Better performance
- Seamless integration between Windows and WSL
- Shared extensions and settings
- Access to Windows clipboard
- Better system resource management

After installation, useful VS Code extensions for WSL development:
- Remote - WSL
- Remote Development
- WSL: Ubuntu (or your distro)

You can launch VS Code in your WSL project directory anytime by typing `code .` in the terminal.


## install poetry to manage multiple environments 
I'll help you install Poetry in WSL. Here's the recommended installation process:

1. Install using the official installer:
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

2. Add Poetry to your PATH by adding this line to your `~/.bashrc` (for bash) or `~/.zshrc` (for zsh):
a) First, let's find out which shell you're using
```bash
echo $SHELL
```
This will output something like /bin/bash or /bin/zsh
Based on your shell, you'll need to edit the correct configuration file:
For bash: ~/.bashrc
For zsh: ~/.zshrc
b) You can edit the file using any text editor like nano or vim. Let's use nano as it's simpler:
```bash
nano ~/.bashrc  # if using bash
# or
nano ~/.zshrc   # if using zsh
```
c) In the editor, scroll to the bottom and add the below line:
```bash
export PATH="/home/$USER/.local/bin:$PATH"
```
d) Save the file:
If using nano: Press Ctrl + X, then Y to confirm, then Enter to save
If using vim: Press Esc, type :wq, then press Enter

3. Reload your shell configuration:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc if using zsh
```

4. Verify the installation:
```bash
poetry --version
```

5. (Optional) Configure Poetry to create virtual environments in the project directory:
```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

Common Poetry commands:
```bash
# Start a new project
poetry new my-project

# Initialize poetry in existing project
poetry init

# Add dependencies
poetry add requests

# Add dev dependencies
poetry add pytest --group dev

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Activate virtual environment
poetry shell
```

Let me know if you need help with any specific Poetry configurations or encounter any issues!
