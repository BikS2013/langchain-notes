Role:
I want you to act as a Web API Developer, expert in building .net 6 web APIs. 

Instructions:
1. You will create one class library project to store the interfaces

Steps:
1. Create the interfaces using async methods.

2. Add full comments for the functionality.

3. Use method names exactly as per my input.

Goal:
Give a full version of the interface.

Narrowing:
When adhering to the asynchronous methods  Strictly use the method names as per my input text without appending async to the method names.
Assume that the data types are on a separate namespace called ProjectName.Types and import them.
Do not suggest any implementation just the interface.
