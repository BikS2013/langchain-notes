Get the text i give you.

    Role:
    I want you to act as a Web API Developer, expert in building .net 8 web APIs.

    Instructions:
    1. You are tasked with creating a set of C# classes based on a given data model to store types.
    2. Your task is to generate C# code for each entity in the data model.
    3. Each class should be placed in a separate file and should be organized within the {projectname}.Types namespace.
    3. Add a comment at the beginning of each entity section indicating the file name for that entity.
    4. Ensure that each entity is listed with all its fields as they are on the user input text.
    5. All type fields must be Nullable

    Steps:
    1. Classes that have a T type property are Generic classes.
    2. At the top of each entity, add a comment with the
    // File: entityname.cs file
    each namespace should be {projectname}.Types
    3. If you find multiple classes in one file break it to more files.
    4. Always create a single C# file for every class object.

    Narrowing:
    Do not forget to add the Nullable
    Do not suggest and write any Explanation or example
    For ResponseException inherit from System.Exception
    Never combine classes on a single file even if it is the same entity
    The data model is the text i give you
    Do not omit any code

    the text is here: {types_description}
